        <p>
          ChatGPT is a huge phenomenon and a major paradigm shift in the
          accelerating march of technological progression. Artificial
          intelligence (AI) research company OpenAI released a free preview of
          the chatbot in November 2022, and by January 2023, it had more than a
          million users. So, what is chatgpt? It's a large language model (LLM)
          that belongs to a category of AI called generative AI , which can
          generate new content rather than simply analyze existing data.<br /><br />
          Additionally, anyone can interact with ChatGPT (GPT stands for
          generative pre-trained transformer) in their own words. A natural,
          humanlike dialog ensues.<br /><br />
          ChatGPT is often directly accessed online by users, but it is also
          being integrated with several existing applications, such as Microsoft
          Office apps (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) and the Bing search engine.
          The number of app integrations seems to grow every day as existing
          software providers hurry to capitalize on ChatGPT's popularity.

        <h3 class="Article--sub-heading">What is ChatGPT used for?</h3>
        <p>
          The ways to use ChatGPT are as varied as its users. Most people lean
          towards more basic requests, such as creating a poem, an essay, or
          short marketing content. Students often turn to it to do their
          homework. Heads up, kids: ChatGPT stinks at answering riddles and
          sometimes word problems in math. Other times, it just makes things up.
          In general, people tend to use ChatGPT to guide or explain something,
          as if the bot were a fancier version of a search engine. Nothing is
          wrong with that use, but ChatGPT can do so much more. How much more
          depends on how well you write the prompt. If you write a basic prompt,
          you’ll get a bare-bones answer that you could have found using a
          search engine such as Google or Bing. That’s the most common reason
          why people abandon ChatGPT after a few uses. They erroneously believe
          it has nothing new to offer. But this particular failing is the user’s
          fault, not ChatGPT’s.

        <h3 class="Article--sub-heading">What can ChatGPT do?</h3>
        <p>
          This list covers just some of the more unique uses of this technology.
          Users have asked ChatGPT to:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conduct an interview with a long-dead legendary figure regarding
            their views of contemporary topics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommend colors and color combinations for logos, fashion designs,
            and interior decorating designs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate original works such as articles, e-books, and ad copy.
          </li>
          <li>Predict the outcome of a business scenario.</li>
          <li>
            Develop an investment strategy based on stock market history and
            current economic conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a diagnosis based on a patient’s real-world test results.
          </li>
          <li>Write computer code to make a new computer game from scratch.</li>
          <li>Leverage sales leads.</li>
          <li>
            Inspire ideas for a variety of things from A/B testing to podcasts,
            webinars, and full-feature films.
          </li>
          <li>Calculate the terms of an agreement into total costs.</li>
          <li>Teach a skill or get instructions for a complex task.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Much ado has been made of ChatGPT's creativity. But that creativity is
          a reflection and result of the human doing the prompting. If you can
          think it, you can probably get ChatGPT to play along.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Unfortunately, that’s true for bad guys too. For example, they can
          prompt ChatGPT to find vulnerabilities in computer code or a computer
          system; steal your identity by writing a document in your style, tone,
          and word choices; or edit an audio clip or a video clip to fool your
          biometric security measures or make it say something you didn’t
          actually say. Only their imagination limits the possibilities for harm
          and chaos.

        <h3 class="Article--sub-heading">How does ChatGPT work?</h3>
        <p>
          ChatGPT works differently than a search engine. A search engine, such
          as Google or Bing, or an AI assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, or Google
          Assistant, works by searching the internet for matches to the keywords
          you enter in the search bar. Algorithms refine the results based on
          any number of factors, but your browser history, topic interests,
          purchase data, and location data usually figure into the equation.<br /><br />
          You’re then presented with a list of search results ranked in order of
          relevance as determined by the search engine’s algorithm. From there,
          the user is free to consider the sources of each option and click a
          selection to do a deeper dive for more details from that source.<br /><br />
          By comparison, ChatGPT generates its own unified answer to your
          prompt. It doesn't offer citations or note its sources. You ask; it
          answers. Easy-peasey, right? No. That task is incredibly hard for AI
          to do, which is why generative AI is so impressive.<br /><br />
          Generating an original result in response to a prompt is achieved by
          using either the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) or GPT-4
          model to analyze the prompt with context and predict the words that
          are likely to follow. Both GPT models are extremely powerful large
          language models capable of processing billions of words per second.<br /><br />
          In short, transformers enable ChatGPT to generate coherent, humanlike
          text as a response to a prompt. ChatGPT creates a response by
          considering context and assigning weight (values) to words that are
          likely to follow the words in the prompt to predict which words would
          be an appropriate response.<br /><br />
          Some ChatGPT basics here: User input is called a prompt rather than a
          command or a query, although it can take either form. You are, in
          effect, prompting AI to predict and complete a pattern that you
          initiated by entering the prompt.
